# Django Sales Finder

https://djangosalesfinder.herokuapp.com/

<strong>Django Sales Finder</strong> is a website that uses <strong>webscraping</strong> to find discounted clothes and shoes from many different websites. It displays them as they are offered by a single website. Usually if you want to find the best deals you have to check each website individually, entering your preferences like type of clothes, brand and size on each website. This project does this for you and shows you only the discounted items. The website is uploaded on Heroku.
